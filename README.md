# 2020-covid19-summary-bangladesh
I've collected information on daily infections, test rates,deaths, etc. from DGHS's website and created an Excel file with the data.
From there, I've made this summary PDF.
All information in this PDF are collected from various websites
(But mainly from the Government website).
Please don't edit or copy.
Thanks for viewing!
